## What is Jeka

Jeka is simple robot named Karel that lives in an environment consisting of a grid of streets (left-right) and avenues (up-down). Jeka understands  basic instructions:
- `moveForward`: Jeka moves by one square in the direction he is facing 
- `turnLeft`: Jeka turns 90 Â° left
-  `woof`: Jeka barks at yout (friendly)
-  `frontIsClear`: Jeka tells you if you can move forward in the facing direction
- `putBeeper`: Jeka puts a beeper on the square he is standing at ( -- coming soon),
- `pickBeeper`: Jeka piack a beeper from the square he is standing at ( -- coming soon)



## How does Jeka work?

Jeka has 4 main modules:

- ***Mustang*** (custom language interpreter that takes the code you write and translates it to the commands known to Jeka)
- ***BoardController*** (module that takes care of drawing Jeka, Jeka's World and Jeka's moves)
- ***Engine*** (module that is responsible for connecting `Mustang` and `BoardController`
- ***CodeController*** (module that takes care of getting user's input to the `Engine`)

## Demo Code

Valid Jeka code example (success of running directly this code depends in the Jeka's World)

```
moveForward();
turnLeft();

fun turnRight(){
  turnLeft();
  turnLeft();
}

var i = 0;

while(i < 5){
  turnRight();
  i = i + 1;
}

while(frontIsClear()){
  moveForward();
}

turnRight();

```

## Running Locally

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode on port: 3000.

### `npm run ts`

Typescript check.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
